[An extremophile ecosystem on a femtosatellite](https://github.com/ProjectPersephone/SlowWalker/wiki/Project-Slow-Walker)

This repo contains all hardware design information, software and related documentation for a project to put an ecosystem on a femtosatellite. The top of the food chain in the ecosystem will consist of Tardigrades. The chosen femtosatellite is the KickSat Sprite. The hope is to launch one or more of these ecosystems on KickSat II or on some subsequent mission that launches similar femtosats.
